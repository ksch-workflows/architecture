# Introduction and Goals

[K.S.C.H. Workflows](https://ksch-workflows.github.io) is a prototype for a custom-built hospital information system (HIS) for the [Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital](https://kirpal-sagar.org/en/kirpal-charitable-hospital-en/).

For the time being it should be considered as academic endevour, aimed at learning to build solid software systems, outside of the commercial pressure of normal software projects and health care facilities.

## Quality goals

Out of the quality attributes classified by the ISO 25010 standard, the following three are the most important:

| **Quality goal** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Maintainability  | The system can be extended, corrected, and adapted to changes in the environment and requirements.  |
| Correctness | The system delivers functionality according to the explicit and implicit requirements. |
| Security | Confidentiality, integretry, and availability. |
