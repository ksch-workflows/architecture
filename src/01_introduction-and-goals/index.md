# Introduction and Goals

[K.S.C.H. Workflows](https://ksch-workflows.github.io) is a prototype for a custom-built hospital information system (HIS) for the [Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital](https://kirpal-sagar.org/en/kirpal-charitable-hospital-en/).

For the time being it should be considered as academic endevour, aimed at learning to build solid software systems, outside of the commercial pressure of normal software projects and health care facilities.

## Quality goals

- The software needs to be reliable. Thus the source code should have maximum simplicity.
- The software needs to be simple to operate, so that the KSCH staff can operate is by themselves.
- The software needs to be fast.
- There should be no vendor lock-in so that the KSCH doesn't have a strong binding dependency on any external company.
