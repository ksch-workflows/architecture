# Introduction and Goals

[K.S.C.H. Workflows](https://ksch-workflows.github.io) is a prototype for a custom-built hospital information system (HIS) for the [Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital](https://kirpal-sagar.org/en/kirpal-charitable-hospital-en/).

For the time being it should be considered as academic endevour, aimed at learning to build solid software systems, outside of the commercial pressure of normal software projects and health care facilities.
