# Archive Flutter Web app

## Context

- Currently there is only one developer maintaining this project.
- Flutter Web is a great technology, but not yet commonly used in enterprise applications.
- React and Angular are commonly used in enterprise applications.
- Keeping up-to-date with more than two technology stacks (Java/Spring, Dart/Flutter, JavaScript/React) is too time-consuming.

## Decision

- The backend of the KSCH Workflows system is developed with production-quality.
- The frontend of the KSCH Workflows system is developed in prototype-quaility.
  - The frontend technology gets now replaced from Flutter Web to React/Bootstrap.
  - In a few month it may again get replaced with Angular.
  - It is assumed that the frontend gets re-created from scratch if professional frontend developers and/or designers join the project.
